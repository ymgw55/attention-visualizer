# Attention Visualizer

An interactive visualization tool for understanding attention mechanisms in transformer models, including Multi-Head Attention (MHA), Grouped Query Attention (GQA), and Multi-Query Attention (MQA). Also supports KV caching, sliding window attention, and attention sinks visualization.

## Features

- **Multiple Attention Types**: Supports MHA, GQA, and MQA visualization
- **KV Cache Visualization**: Shows cached values with hatched patterns to understand inference optimization
- **Sliding Window Attention**: Configurable attention window sizes for local attention patterns
- **Attention Sinks**: Allows attention to initial tokens in sliding window for efficient streaming
- **Interactive Visualization**: Color-coded highlighting with play/pause animation and step-by-step exploration
